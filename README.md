# Cost-Effective-Deadline-Constrained-Scheduling-in-Cloud

This problem is of scheduling applications modeled as a directed acyclic graph in a cost-effective way subject to a given deadline in a multi-cloud system. The model
includes the billing mechanisms and costs for transferring data across clouds for different cloud providers. Our proposed methodology is compared with the following state-of-art algorithms:
